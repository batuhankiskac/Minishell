# Valgrind Leak Report: `ls -l | grep .c | wc -l`

**Date:** July 7, 2025
**Command Executed:** `valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell -c "ls -l | grep .c | wc -l"`

## Summary

The Valgrind analysis for the command `ls -l | grep .c | wc -l` shows:

*   **Definitely lost:** 0 bytes in 0 blocks
*   **Indirectly lost:** 0 bytes in 0 blocks
*   **Possibly lost:** 0 bytes in 0 blocks
*   **Still reachable:** 228,818 bytes in 233 blocks

## Analysis of Still Reachable Memory

Consistent with previous reports, all reported "still reachable" memory blocks are associated with external libraries:

*   `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libreadline.so.8.2`
*   `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6.4`

These are standard libraries used for command-line input and terminal handling. The "still reachable" status for memory allocated by these libraries is expected and does not indicate a memory leak within your minishell's code. These resources are typically held by the libraries for the duration of the program's execution.

## Conclusion

Based on this Valgrind report, there are **no memory leaks originating from your minishell's custom code** for the `ls -l | grep .c | wc -l` test case. The "still reachable" blocks are from external libraries and do not represent a memory management issue within your project's source code.
